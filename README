jQuery terminal is a simple way to create a terminal like UI in the browser.

It accepts new commands via the register function on the terminal object.

e.g. $('#terminal').data('terminal').register('echo', function() {
      this.print(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).join(' '));
    }, 'This function returns the arguments passed to it.');

This is very much a work in progress.
